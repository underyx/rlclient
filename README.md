# rlclient

## Summary

A client to communicate with the Rocket League game coordinator servers.

Two things to keep in mind:

 - This package is expected to change a lot between versions. If you want to use
   it, pin the requirement spec to the latest version! A minor version will be
   bumped for a breaking API change (such as adding a parser for a new call
   type.)

 - We're accessing a private API here, so don't be surprised if your stuff just
   randomly breaks due to some change by Psyonix.

## Installation

```
pip3.5 install rlclient
```

## Configuration

Instantiate the client with `RocketLeagueClient('login_key', 'session_key')`.
You can pass a specific session ID in the third parameter (and omit the login
key which is only used for opening sessions) or even change the environment
from the default `Prod` with the fourth parameter.

Alternatively, you can use the `RLCLIENT_LOGIN_KEY`, `RLCLIENT_SESSION_KEY`,
`RLCLIENT_SESSION_ID` and `RLCLIENT_ENVIRONMENT` environment variables, and pass
no parameters to the client in your code.

## Usage

The basic usage goes like this:

```python
>>> from rlclient import RocketLeagueClient
>>> client = RocketLeagueClient()  # auth details are set in the environment
>>> call = client.GetPopulationAllPlaylists()
>>> client.request([call])[0]
{0: 35670, 1: 924, 2: 8398, 3: 10827, 4: 2017, 6: 3127, 7: 3926, 8: 7123, 9: 2928, 10: 2230, 11: 14718, 12: 2950, 13: 7358, 15: 801, 16: 1629, -2: 3961}
```

The client supports grouping multiple calls into one request, too, if the
call happens to support this on the backend:

```python
>>> calls = [
...     client.GetSkillLeaderboard_v2(10),
...     client.GetSkillLeaderboard_v2(11),
...     client.GetSkillLeaderboard_v2(12),
... ]
>>> responses = client.request(calls)
>>> [len(response) for response in responses]
[200, 200, 200]
```

If the call doesn't support this on the backendâ€¦ don't worry! I've still got
your back. The client is smart enough to figure out all of it:

```python
>>> calls = [
...     client.GetPopulationAllPlaylists(),
...     client.GetSkillLeaderboard_v2(10),   #\
...     client.GetSeasonalPlaylists(),       # these three are grouped into one HTTP request
...     client.GetGenericDataAll(),          #/
...     client.GetPopulationAllPlaylists(),
... ]
>>> responses = client.request(calls)  # sends three HTTP requests
>>> for call, response in zip(calls, responses):
...     print('{0}: {1}'.format(call.method, response))
...
